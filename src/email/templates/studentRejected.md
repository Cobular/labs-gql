Hi {{ student.givenName }},

Unfortunately, we are not able to offer you acceptance to CodeDay Labs at this time. We recieved an unprecedented number
of applicants for a limited number of slots, and regretfully we could not find a good match for you.

Although we cannot match you this year, we hope you find a fun and valuable summer experience of some sort (even if it's
working on personal projects), and hope your future in tech is bright!
