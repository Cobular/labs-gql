Hi {{ student.givenName }},

We're excited you have accepted your offer for CodeDay Labs ({{ student.weeks }}-week program).
Here's what you should know about the next steps:

1. The next step is **matching:** several weeks before the start of the program, we'll provide you with a number of
  project options, and you'll need to pick your favorites.
2. We will **introduce** you to your final project (one of your picks) a few days before the start of the program.
3. The first week of CodeDay Labs is **onboarding,** which is where you'll get up-to-speed on the technology used in your
  project by completing some workshops and tutorials recommended by your mentor.
4. You'll start on **project work** with your teammates after the first week.
5. At the end of CodeDay Labs, we will ask you to submit a 2-minute demo and 10-to-15-minute tech talk.

Some other pro-tips:

- We'll have tech and career talks on most weekdays during the program, except the first week (onboarding) and last week.
  These aren't required, but we recommend you attend a few and ask questions to the speaker (a good way to network).
- When you list this on your resume or LinkedIn, most students list the position as "Labs Intern at CodeDay" with a
  description of the format "Under the guidance of (mentor) from (company), worked on (project description)." Remember
  that even though your mentor works for a tech company, you're not an intern for that company.
- CodeDay Labs isn't compatible with most full-time jobs or internships. If you're no longer able to spend your promised
  minimum {{ student.minHours }} hours a week on this, please let us know.
- CodeDay Labs is not a traditional paid internship, and you're not an employee of CodeDay. (Some schools have a
  partnership where students are paid a stipend while participating. This isn't through CodeDay, and we won't be able
  to answer any questions about it. If you haven't been told this applies to you already, it most likely does not.)

If you have any questions, you can reply to this email.
