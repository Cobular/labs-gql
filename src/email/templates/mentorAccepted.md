We're so excited to have you as a mentor at CodeDay Labs, {{ mentor.givenName }}!

**Important:** [Please review and make any changes to your project here.](https://labs.codeday.org/dash/m/{{ tokenFor mentor }})
We'll provide that description there to prospective students as they choose which project they'd like to work on.

Some other next-steps to expect:

- We'll provide you with some training information (including schedule, what resources your students have, and protips)
  a few weeks before the program starts.
- You can expect to be introduced to your student one week before CodeDay Labs starts. (Student onboarding week.)
