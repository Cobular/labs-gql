Hi {{ student.givenName }},

This email confirms we have received your CodeDay Labs application.

We do rolling admissions, so you may hear back from us at any time. The latest you can expect to hear back is 2-3 weeks
before the start of the program.

If we're able to offer you a spot, you will get an email here and have three days to accept.

We encourage you to continue to look for traditional, paid internships with technology companies while you wait. CodeDay
Labs is a great alternative if you can't find one, but we think a traditional internship would provide the best
experience for you.
