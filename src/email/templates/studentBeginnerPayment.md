Hi {{ student.givenName }},

Thanks for accepting your offer in the CodeDay Labs Beginner-Track! This is an extremely competitive program and
we're very glad you'll be joining us this summer!

[The final step is to pay for your spot, which should be completed within the next three days.](https://labs.codeday.org/apply/beginner/payment)

(If you applied for and received a scholarship, you can ignore this email.)

We've included some more information about CodeDay Labs below. (If your parents are the ones paying, we recommend
you forward this email to them.)


### What You're Signing Up For

The core of CodeDay Labs is individual work in collaboration to build a real-world project. The experience CodeDay Labs
provides is impossible to replicate with traditional classes or workshop-based summer programs. The program has been
operating for over 5 years with its thousands of alumni in hundreds of top universities and tech companies around the
world, and its success is the subject of research presented at the 2021 ACM SIGCSE conference.

The first week of Labs is onboarding training to learn the basics of the language and tech stack your project will use,
followed by 5 weeks of mentorship focused on a specific project in a small group. We will recommend up to 20 of these
based on your application, and you can select your top 5 choices.

After onboarding, your project's mentor will meet with your group twice a week, and will also hold 2-3 one-on-one
meetings throughout the program. Outside of these meetings you are expected to work individually and with your teammates
to make progress on your project.

You will also have access to optional tech-talks throughout July.


### About the CodeDay Labs Team

CodeDay Labs is a program of CodeDay, a 501(c)(3) non-profit which operates programs reaching 60,000 students around
the world, and which has been featured in NPR's All Things Considered, TechCrunch, Forbes, and more.

CodeDay Labs is led by Tyler Menezes, the former technical founder of a Y Combinator and venture-backed tech startup
who has been named one of Forbes Magazine's "30 Under 30" and "Top Canadians Under 30", 425 Business Magazine's "30
Under 30", and Tech&Learning Magazine's "Top Innovators in EdTech", among others.

The design of the program was advised by Kevin Wang, founder of the Microsoft TEALS program featured in the New York
Times for bringing CS Education to 60,000 students in classrooms around the US, and a member of the Washington State
Board of Education.
